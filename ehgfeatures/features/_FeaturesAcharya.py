    TODO: 
        1) if I understood correctly, there is no preprocessing applied, the preprocessing they describe is implicitly in the database
        2) I have no idea how they compute "Fuzzy Entropy", they do not cite it. As a fuzzy technique, Fuzzy entropy needs some sort of a membership function
            but there is no clue on it.
        3) How to treat the three channels? From the paper it seems that they use only one.
    
    Number of features according to the paper: 1056, but fuzzy entropy is not implemented, therefore 7*11*12 = 924
